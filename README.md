# Simple Menu

A Python Flask application to display menu items on a display via a webpage


## Background

For a convenience store, being able to add and modify menu items as customer needs change is a powerful tool. Often, small delis do not need, or afford, a robust solution offered by most digital signage solution, OOS or commercial. This offers a basic webpage to showcase different sections of items and to be able to adjust their prices via a simple web form.
